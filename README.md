Working memory limitations can significantly hinder a student's ability to follow fast-paced lectures and retain critical information. Traditional methods of dealing with the problem involving note-taking apps or lecture recordings often have limitations in being time efficient, capturing the essence of a lecture and being more cognitively heavy. Due to this research gap, new strategies for making lectures more accessible to students with working memory problems should be investigated. This research project examines the potential of real-time NLP as an accessibility technology to address these challenges and role of visual representations in enhancing learning and knowledge synthesis, both, for people with working memory problems as well as mild hearing disabilities, and even extends to average learners.

We developed a high-fidelity prototype of a technology-based approach to improve accessibility of lectures and learning materials for individuals with working memory impairments, with proper literature review, design space and problem space description, design issues for the proposed solution. And demonstrated several prototypes: storyboards, sketches & wireframes.
